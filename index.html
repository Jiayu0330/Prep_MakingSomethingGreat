      <li>Why is visualization effective?</li>
        <p>Because "vision is the most developed sense in the human species" (Cairo, 123).
          In other words, it is easier and faster for human to get the idea if "mapping data
          into visual properties" (Cairo, 123). (People are too lazy to read text and data:)</p>
        <div class="imgs">
          <img src="interestsBarChart.png" alt="interestsBarChart" width="456" height="280" />
          <img src="interestsData.PNG" alt="interestsData" width="133.5" height="360" />
        </div>
        <p>Example: As we can see above, it is definitely easier and more effectiveto read bar
          chart instead of two columns of data.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <li>What are the more effective ways to encode data for perceptual tasks?</li>
        <p>Choose and construct chart "based on elementary tasks 'as high in the hierarchy
          as possible.'" (Cairo, 129), which means the chart should make viewers quickly
          and directly get what the author wants to show.</p>
        <div class="imgs">
          <img src="interestsBarChart.png" alt="interestsBarChart" width="456" height="280" />
          <img src="interestsLineChart.png" alt="interestsLineChart" width="456" height="280" />
      </div>
      <p>Example: It is important to choose the right graphic form. Line chart doesn't make
        any sense here, becuase what we want to see is the mean of each term instead of <thead>
        tendency.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
      <li>What are trade-offs that Cairo asks us to consider when building a visualization?</li>
        <p>We need to consider if we want to show readers big picture or the details. We have
          to make decision - in general or in detai. If we want to give a general conclusion,
          we can use area, volume, shading and saturation, color hue, etc. If we want to show
          some detailed information, we should use bar, line, scatter and so on. For example,
          if we want to make a choropleth map, color hue works vey well, while our purpose
          is to reveal geographic clusters. However, we can't give readers specific information
          by applying color hue.</p>
